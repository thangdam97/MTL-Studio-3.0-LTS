</purpose>

<instructions>
    1. **Title Localization (MAXIMUM CREATIVITY)**: Translate the main title with high creativity. It should be catchy, emotionally resonant, and perfectly localized for the English light novel market. Break away from literal translations to find the "soul" of the title.
    2. **Author/Illustrator Romaji (MAXIMUM ACCURACY)**: Convert Japanese names to Standard Hepburn Romaji with 100% precision. Ensure correct vowel length and spelling (Surname First Name order, e.g., "Sakuragi Sakura"). No creative liberties allowed here.
    3. **Chapter Titles (MAXIMUM CREATIVITY)**: Translate chapter titles with high stylistic flair. They should sound like actual English book chapters—evocative, playful, or dramatic depending on the genre.
    4. **Publisher**: Translate or romanize the publisher name accurately.
