# ELLIPSES & ONOMATOPOEIA SANITIZATION MODULE

## Purpose
This module provides expert guidance for handling Japanese ellipses (……), filler sounds, and onomatopoeia in light novel translation. The goal is **natural English prose** that preserves emotional intent without literal translation of Japanese text artifacts.

---

## Core Philosophy: Hybrid Localization

**Principle:** We transcreate based on context and intent, not literal translation.

**Exception:** Preserve signature Japanese otaku culture onomatopoeia for specific cases (e.g., "fufu" laughter, "ara ara").

---

## PART 1: ELLIPSES SANITIZATION

### Problem: Japanese Ellipsis Addiction

Japanese light novel authors frequently use leading ellipses (……) as a stylistic device. In English, this creates awkward, over-punctuated prose.

### Rules

#### Rule 1: Remove Leading Ellipses (95% of cases)

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
「……ん？　これは……」
「……美月が起きてるのか。珍しいな」
「……そうだね」
```

**❌ BAD (Literal):**
```
"...Hmm? This is..."
"...Mitsuki's awake? That's unusual."
"...Yeah, you're right."
```

**✅ GOOD (Sanitized):**
```
"Hmm? This is..."
"Mitsuki's awake? That's unusual."
"Yeah, you're right."
```

**Rationale:** English uses capitalization to start sentences. Leading ellipses are redundant and create visual clutter.

---

#### Rule 2: Preserve Meaningful Pauses (5% of cases)

**Keep leading ellipses when:**
1. **Long pause (3+ seconds)** - Character is genuinely hesitating
2. **Trailing thought** - Continuation from previous dialogue
3. **Emotional weight** - Silence conveys meaning

**Example 1: Long Pause**
```japanese
「……言えない」(After 10 seconds of silence)
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
"...I can't say it."
```

**Example 2: Trailing Thought**
```japanese
[Previous scene: "I wonder if..."]
[New scene]
「……やっぱり無理だ」
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
"...No, it's impossible after all."
```

**Example 3: Emotional Weight**
```japanese
「……ごめん」(Character is crying)
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
"...Sorry."
```

---

#### Rule 3: Mid-Sentence Ellipses

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
「これは……どうしよう」
「君が……好きだ」
```

**✅ GOOD (Preserve):**
```
"This is... what should I do?"
"I... love you."
```

**Rationale:** Mid-sentence ellipses indicate hesitation or emotional struggle. These are meaningful in both languages.

---

#### Rule 4: Trailing Ellipses

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
「そうだね……」
「分からない……」
```

**✅ GOOD (Preserve):**
```
"Yeah..."
"I don't know..."
```

**Rationale:** Trailing ellipses indicate trailing off, uncertainty, or unfinished thoughts. Natural in English.

---

## PART 2: FILLER SOUNDS SANITIZATION

### Problem: Vocalized Fillers

Japanese uses vocalized fillers (あ、ん、えっと) that sound awkward when literally translated to English.

### Rules

#### Rule 1: Remove Meaningless Fillers

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
「あ、そうだね」
「ん、分かった」
「えっと……これは」
```

**❌ BAD (Literal):**
```
"Ah, you're right."
"Nn, got it."
"Uhh... this is..."
```

**✅ GOOD (Cleaned):**
```
"You're right."
"Got it."
"This is..."
```

**Rationale:** These fillers add no semantic value. English readers find them distracting.

---

#### Rule 2: Convert to Narrative Description

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
「あ、あはは……ごめん」
「え、えっと……」
```

**❌ BAD (Literal):**
```
"Ah, ahaha... sorry."
"Eh, uhh..."
```

**✅ GOOD (Transcreated):**
```
She laughed awkwardly. "Sorry."
He hesitated. "Well..."
```

**Alternative (Keep Natural Filler):**
```
"Haha... sorry."
"Um..."
```

**Rationale:** Narrative beats convey the same emotional state more elegantly.

---

#### Rule 3: Preserve Meaningful Fillers

**Keep fillers when they:**
1. **Characterize speech patterns** - Character always says "Ah" before speaking
2. **Convey surprise** - Genuine reaction, not filler
3. **Create rhythm** - Part of character voice

**Example 1: Characterization**
```japanese
「あー、そういえば……」(Character's signature speech pattern)
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
"Ah, now that you mention it..."
```

**Example 2: Genuine Surprise**
```japanese
「あっ！　危ない！」
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
"Ah! Watch out!"
```

## PART 3: ONOMATOPOEIA HANDLING

### Hybrid Localization Approach

**Core Rule:** Transcreate for natural English, but preserve signature Japanese otaku culture sounds.

---

### Category 1: Fully Localize (90% of cases)

**Japanese → English Equivalent**

| Japanese | Context | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ドキドキ (dokidoki) | Heartbeat | *Thump-thump* / *Ba-dump* |
| ガタガタ (gatagata) | Shaking | *Rattle rattle* / *Clatter* |
| ゴクリ (gokuri) | Gulp | *Gulp* |
| バタン (batan) | Door slam | *Slam* / *Bang* |
| ザワザワ (zawazawa) | Crowd murmur | *Murmur murmur* |
| シーン (shiin) | Silence | *Silence* / *Cricket chirps* |
| ピカピカ (pikapika) | Sparkling | *Sparkle* / *Glitter* |

**Example:**
```japanese
心臓がドキドキと鳴っている。
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
My heart was pounding. *Thump-thump.*
```

---

### Category 2: Preserve Japanese (10% of cases)

**Signature Otaku Culture Sounds** - Keep these for cultural flavor:

| Japanese | Usage | Preserve? |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| ふふ (fufu) | Refined laughter | ✅ YES |
| あらあら (ara ara) | Mature woman surprise | ✅ YES |
| うふふ (ufufu) | Teasing laughter | ✅ YES |
| えへへ (ehehe) | Embarrassed giggle | ✅ YES |
| むふふ (mufufu) | Mischievous chuckle | ✅ YES |

**Example:**
```japanese
「ふふ、可愛いわね」
```
**✅ GOOD:**
```
"Fufu, how adorable."
```

**Rationale:** These are recognized by English LN readers as character voice markers. Localizing to "Hehe" loses the cultural nuance.

---

### Category 3: Narrative Integration

**For complex onomatopoeia, integrate into narrative:**

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
ガシャーン！　皿が割れた。
```

**❌ BAD (Literal):**
```
*Gashan!* The plate broke.
```

**✅ GOOD (Integrated):**
```
The plate shattered with a loud *crash*.
```

**Alternative (Keep Sound):**
```
*Crash!* The plate broke.
```

---

## PART 4: LAUGHTER SANITIZATION

### Problem: Japanese Laughter Variety

Japanese has many laughter types (あはは, えへへ, ふふ, くすくす). Literal translation creates awkward English.

### Rules

#### Rule 1: Standard Laughter

**Japanese → English**

| Japanese | Character Type | English |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| あはは (ahaha) | Casual, loud | "Haha" / "Ahaha" |
| わはは (wahaha) | Boisterous | "Wahaha" / "Bwahaha" |
| くすくす (kusukusu) | Giggling | "Hehe" / *Giggle* |
| にやにや (niyaniya) | Smirking | *Smirk* / "Heh" |

**Example:**
```japanese
「あはは、面白いね」
```

**❌ BAD:**
```
"Ahaha, that's funny."
```

**✅ GOOD:**
```
"Haha, that's funny."
```

**Alternative (Narrative):**
```
She laughed. "That's funny."
```

---

#### Rule 2: Refined Laughter (Preserve)

**Keep Japanese for character voice:**

| Japanese | Character Type | Preserve |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| ふふ (fufu) | Ojou-sama, refined | ✅ YES |
| おほほ (ohoho) | Haughty ojou | ✅ YES |
| うふふ (ufufu) | Mature, teasing | ✅ YES |

**Example:**
```japanese
「ふふ、そうね」
```

**✅ GOOD:**
```
"Fufu, I suppose so."
```

---

#### Rule 3: Awkward Laughter

**Convert to narrative or natural English:**

**Japanese Pattern:**
```
「あ、あはは……」
「え、えへへ……」
```

**❌ BAD:**
```
"Ah, ahaha..."
"Eh, ehehe..."
```

**✅ GOOD (Narrative):**
```
She laughed awkwardly.
He gave an embarrassed chuckle.
```

**✅ GOOD (Natural):**
```
"Haha..."
"Hehe..."
```

## PART 5: DECISION FLOWCHART

### For Ellipses:

```
Is it leading ellipses?
├─ YES → Does it indicate 3+ second pause OR emotional weight?
│        ├─ YES → KEEP: "...I can't."
│        └─ NO → REMOVE: "I can't."
└─ NO → Is it mid-sentence or trailing?
         └─ YES → KEEP: "I... can't." / "I can't..."
```

### For Fillers:

```
Is it a vocalized filler (あ、ん、えっと)?
├─ YES → Does it add semantic value or characterization?
│        ├─ YES → KEEP or TRANSCREATE: "Ah!" / He hesitated.
│        └─ NO → REMOVE: "Got it." (not "Nn, got it.")
└─ NO → Not a filler, translate normally
```

### For Onomatopoeia:

```
Is it signature otaku culture sound (fufu, ara ara)?
├─ YES → PRESERVE: "Fufu, how cute."
└─ NO → Is there a natural English equivalent?
         ├─ YES → LOCALIZE: *Thump-thump* (not dokidoki)
         └─ NO → INTEGRATE: "shattered with a crash"
```

---

## PART 6: QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing translation, verify:

- [ ] **Leading ellipses removed** unless emotionally meaningful
- [ ] **Meaningless fillers removed** (あ、ん、えっと)
- [ ] **Awkward laughter converted** to narrative or natural English
- [ ] **Signature sounds preserved** (fufu, ara ara, ufufu)
- [ ] **Generic onomatopoeia localized** to English equivalents
- [ ] **Emotional intent maintained** despite sanitization

## SUMMARY

**Golden Rules:**
1. **Remove 95% of leading ellipses** - English doesn't need them
2. **Convert fillers to narrative** - "She laughed awkwardly" > "Ah, ahaha"
3. **Preserve signature sounds** - "Fufu" stays, "dokidoki" becomes "thump-thump"
4. **Prioritize natural English** - Readers shouldn't notice the translation

**Result:** Clean, professional prose that reads like native English while preserving emotional intent and cultural flavor.
