# ANTI-FORMAL LANGUAGE MODULE

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Purpose:** Eliminate AI tendency to use overly formal vocabulary in casual contexts
**Target Issue:** LLMs default to "safe" formal words even for teenage casual speech

---

## The Problem: Over-Formality

**Definition:** Using business/academic vocabulary when casual/colloquial language is appropriate.

**Why LLMs Do This:**
- Training on formal text (Wikipedia, news, academic papers)
- Risk aversion: Formal = "professional" = "safe"
- Lack of register awareness: AI doesn't distinguish teenager from businessman
- Thesaurus syndrome: Choosing "sophisticated" synonyms over simple words

**Impact on Light Novels:**
- Teenage characters sound like 40-year-old professors
- Kills authentic voice and generational identity
- Breaks immersion (no high schooler says "shall we commence")
- Makes dialogue stilted and unnatural

---

## Core Principle: MATCH REGISTER TO CHARACTER AGE

**Bad (Over-Formal Teen):**
> "I shall accompany you to the establishment to procure sustenance."

**Good (Natural Teen):**
> "Wanna grab food?"

---

## Section 1: Formal Vocabulary in Casual Dialogue

### 1.1 Action Verbs (Movement/Daily Activities)

**Pattern:** Choosing Latinate/formal verbs over Germanic simple verbs
**Problem:** Teens don't talk like Victorian novels

| ❌ Over-Formal | ✅ Casual Register | 🎯 Character |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "Shall we depart?" | "Wanna go?" / "Let's go." | Teen casual |
| "I must commence studying." | "I gotta start studying." | Teen urgent |
| "Please proceed ahead." | "Go ahead." / "After you." | Polite but natural |
| "I shall accompany you." | "I'll come with you." / "I'll go with you." | Friendly teen |
| "Let us convene at the library." | "Let's meet at the library." | Casual plan |
| "I wish to inquire about..." | "I wanna ask about..." / "Can I ask about..." | Teen curiosity |

**Rule:** Prefer simple Anglo-Saxon verbs (go, get, make, do) over Latinate forms (depart, procure, commence, inquire) for casual speech.

**Register Table:**
| Formal (Avoid in Casual) | Neutral | Casual (Prefer for Teens) |
|-------------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| depart | leave | head out, bail, bounce |
| procure | get | grab, snag, pick up |
| commence | start | kick off, get going |
| inquire | ask | wonder, check |
| accompany | go with | come along, tag along |
| converse | talk | chat, shoot the breeze |
| consume | eat | grab a bite, chow down |

---

### 1.2 Modal Verbs and Contractions

**Pattern:** Using "shall", "ought", full forms ("I will", "I am")
**Problem:** Sounds archaic or ESL-formal

| ❌ Over-Formal | ✅ Casual Register | 🎯 Contraction Rule |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "I shall do it." | "I'll do it." | Always contract in casual |
| "We ought to leave." | "We should leave." / "We gotta go." | "Ought" = archaic outside Ojou |
| "I am going home." | "I'm going home." / "I'm heading home." | Contract "am/is/are" |
| "It would be preferable if..." | "It'd be better if..." / "I'd rather..." | Contract + simpler words |
| "I cannot do that." | "I can't do that." | Negative contractions mandatory |
| "Do you not agree?" | "Don't you think?" / "Right?" | Question tag informality |

**Rule:**
- **ALWAYS contract** in casual dialogue: I'm, you're, we'll, can't, won't, shouldn't
- **AVOID "shall"** unless character is Ojou-sama archetype (<40% frequency)
- **AVOID "ought"** entirely (archaic except literary formal characters)

**Exception:**
- Formal characters (ojou-sama, elderly, nobility): Can use "shall" sparingly
- Emphasis/anger: "I will NOT do that!" (uncontracted for stress)

---

### 1.3 Request Phrasings

**Pattern:** Overly polite formal requests in casual contexts
**Problem:** Friends don't talk like customer service scripts

| ❌ Over-Formal | ✅ Casual Register | 🎯 Context |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| "Would you be so kind as to...?" | "Can you...?" / "Could you...?" | Friend request |
| "If it is not too much trouble..." | "If you don't mind..." / "If it's cool..." | Casual hedge |
| "I would appreciate it if you could..." | "Could you...?" / "Mind if you...?" | Simple ask |
| "May I request your assistance?" | "Can you help me?" / "Need a hand?" | Peer to peer |
| "I must humbly ask..." | "I gotta ask..." / "Quick question..." | Casual preface |

**Rule:** Match politeness to relationship distance (RTAS):
- **RTAS 4.0-5.0** (close friends): "Help me out?" / "Do me a favor?"
- **RTAS 3.0-3.9** (acquaintances): "Could you...?" / "Would you mind...?"
- **RTAS 1.0-2.9** (formal/strangers): "I'd appreciate if..." (formal OK here)

---

### 1.4 Everyday Nouns

**Pattern:** Choosing formal/technical nouns over common words
**Problem:** Makes mundane activities sound like business transactions

| ❌ Over-Formal | ✅ Casual Register | 🎯 Object |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| "establishment" | "place" / "spot" | Restaurant/café |
| "beverage" | "drink" | Any liquid |
| "sustenance" / "nourishment" | "food" | Meal |
| "residence" | "house" / "place" | Home |
| "garment" / "attire" | "clothes" / "outfit" | Clothing |
| "possessions" | "stuff" / "things" | Belongings |
| "vehicle" | "car" | Automobile |
| "literature" | "book" / "novel" | Reading material |

**Rule:** Use the word a teenager would actually use in conversation.

**Generational Test:**
- Ask: "Would a Gen Z kid say this to their friend?"
- If NO → Find simpler synonym

---

### 1.5 Adverbs and Intensifiers

**Pattern:** Formal adverbs ("exceedingly", "remarkably", "considerably")
**Problem:** Teens use simpler intensifiers

| ❌ Over-Formal | ✅ Casual Register | 🎯 Intensity |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "exceedingly difficult" | "super hard" / "really hard" | High intensity |
| "remarkably beautiful" | "crazy beautiful" / "gorgeous" | Admiration |
| "considerably late" | "pretty late" / "way late" | Degree |
| "somewhat tired" | "kinda tired" / "a bit tired" | Mild degree |
| "utterly exhausted" | "totally wiped" / "dead tired" | Complete |
| "entirely certain" | "totally sure" / "positive" | Confidence |

**Rule:** Replace Latinate adverbs with:
- **super, really, pretty, kinda, sorta** (casual modifiers)
- **totally, completely, absolutely** (emphatic)
- **way, hella** (Gen Z slang, use sparingly)

**Formality Scale:**
```
AVOID ← exceedingly, remarkably, considerably, somewhat
USE → super, really, pretty, kinda, totally
SLANG → hella, lowkey, deadass (use <10% for authenticity)
```

---

## Section 2: Sentence Structure Formality

### 2.1 Inverted Questions

**Pattern:** "Can you not...?", "Do you not...?", "Would you not...?"
**Problem:** Sounds ESL-formal or archaic

| ❌ Formal Inversion | ✅ Casual Question | 🎯 Fix |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------|
| "Can you not see the issue?" | "Can't you see the issue?" / "Don't you see the problem?" | Contract negative |
| "Do you not agree?" | "Don't you agree?" / "Right?" | Use tag question |
| "Would you not prefer...?" | "Wouldn't you rather...?" / "Don't you want...?" | Natural contraction |
| "Are you not concerned?" | "Aren't you worried?" | Simpler verb |

**Rule:** Never use "Verb + you + not" → Always "Verb + n't + you"

---

### 2.2 Conditional Structures

**Pattern:** "Should you require...", "Were I to...", "Had I known..."
**Problem:** Hypotheticals sound like legal contracts

| ❌ Formal Conditional | ✅ Casual Conditional | 🎯 Type |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------|
| "Should you require assistance..." | "If you need help..." | Offer |
| "Were I to go there..." | "If I went there..." | Hypothetical |
| "Had I known earlier..." | "If I'd known..." / "If I knew earlier..." | Past regret |
| "Lest we forget..." | "So we don't forget..." / "Before we forget..." | Purpose |

**Rule:** Use standard "if" conditionals for casual speech. Avoid inverted conditionals ("Were I...", "Had I...").

---

### 2.3 Transition Phrases

**Pattern:** Formal connectors from academic writing
**Problem:** Makes narration sound like research paper

| ❌ Formal Transition | ✅ Casual Flow | 🎯 Function |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| "Furthermore, ..." | "Plus, ..." / "And..." / "Also..." | Addition |
| "Nevertheless, ..." | "Still, ..." / "But..." / "Anyway..." | Contrast |
| "Subsequently, ..." | "Then..." / "After that..." | Sequence |
| "Conversely, ..." | "On the other hand..." / "But..." | Opposition |
| "In addition, ..." | "Also..." / "Plus..." | Extra info |
| "Thus, ..." / "Therefore, ..." | "So..." | Conclusion |

**Rule:** Keep transitions simple and invisible. Overuse of formal transitions = essay, not story.

---

## Section 3: Archetype-Specific Exceptions

### 3.1 Ojou-sama Characters (Refined Noble Girls)

**Permission:** Can use formal language IF:
- Character archetype established (heiress, princess, refined upbringing)
- Frequency <40% (mix formal with normal for realism)
- Consistent throughout novel (not random)

**Allowed Formal Patterns:**
- ✅ "If you would excuse me..." (polite departure)
- ✅ "I shall take my leave." (formal exit)
- ✅ "It would be my pleasure." (gracious acceptance)
- ✅ "Pardon my intrusion." (polite entry)

**Still AVOID even for Ojou:**
- ❌ "procure", "establishment", "beverage" (use "get", "café", "tea")
- ❌ "in a [adj] manner" (use adverbs)
- ❌ Full forms without contractions 100% of time (occasional "I'm" is fine)

**Balance Example:**
> "I shall accompany you to the café. I'm quite curious about their desserts."
> (Mix: formal verb "shall" + casual contraction "I'm" = nuanced Ojou)

---

### 3.2 Elderly/Traditional Characters

**Permission:** Can use:
- "ought" (rare)
- Less frequent contractions (50% instead of 80%)
- Slightly formal vocabulary

**Still AVOID:**
- Passive voice spam
- "In a manner" constructions
- Clinical terminology

---

### 3.3 Fantasy/Historical Settings

**Permission:** Dialogue can be more formal IF:
- World setting justifies it (medieval fantasy, historical Japan)
- Applied consistently to all characters in that world
- Still use contractions where natural ("I'll", "can't")

**Example (Fantasy Noble):**
> "I shall not permit such insolence. Leave at once."
> (Formal verbs OK, but still uses contraction "I'll" in casual moments)

---

## Section 4: RTAS-Based Register Switching

**Relationship Tension & Affection Score** determines formality:

| RTAS Score | Relationship | Formality Level | Example Phrasing |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1.0-1.4 | Hostile strangers | Formal, cold | "I would prefer you leave." |
| 1.5-2.4 | Distant acquaintances | Polite but stiff | "Could you please help me?" |
| 2.5-3.4 | Neutral classmates | Standard polite | "Can you help me with this?" |
| 3.5-4.4 | Friends | Casual | "Help me out?" |
| 4.5-5.0 | Close friends/romantic | Very casual | "C'mon, help a guy out?" |

**Rule:** Match vocabulary formality to RTAS. Close friends = simplest words.

---

## Section 5: Narrator Voice Formality

### 5.1 Third-Person Narration

**Pattern:** Formal narrator voice in teen-focused light novel
**Problem:** Creates tonal disconnect between narration and dialogue

| ❌ Formal Narration | ✅ Casual Narration | 🎯 Age Match |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| The establishment was bereft of patrons. | The café was empty. | Match setting tone |
| He proceeded to the educational institution. | He went to school. | Natural description |
| She exhibited considerable trepidation. | She was pretty nervous. | Accessible emotion |
| The beverage was exceedingly palatable. | The drink was really good. | Simple sensory |

**Rule:** Narrator voice should match the age demographic of the story.
- **Teen-focused LN** → Casual, accessible narration
- **Adult literary fiction** → More formal narration OK
- **Fantasy epic** → Slightly elevated language OK (but avoid purple prose)

---

### 5.2 First-Person Narration

**Pattern:** Formal internal monologue from teen POV
**Problem:** Character's thoughts don't match their speech

| ❌ Formal Thoughts | ✅ Casual Thoughts | 🎯 Voice Match |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| I must endeavor to arrive punctually. | I gotta get there on time. | Match dialogue style |
| This predicament is rather vexing. | This is pretty annoying. | Age-appropriate vocab |
| I find myself experiencing considerable anxiety. | I'm kinda freaking out. | Natural internal voice |

**Rule:** First-person narration = character's unfiltered thoughts. Should match their dialogue register exactly.

## Section 6: Implementation Checklist

**Before Submitting Translation, Self-Audit:**

1. **Ctrl+F Search for Red Flag Words:**
   - "shall" → Replace 90% with "will" / "'ll" (keep <10% for Ojou only)
   - "ought" → Replace 100% with "should" (unless elderly character)
   - "procure" → Replace with "get/grab"
   - "establishment" → Replace with "place/café/restaurant"
   - "beverage" → Replace with "drink/coffee/tea"
   - "commence" → Replace with "start"
   - "depart" → Replace with "leave/go"
   - "inquire" → Replace with "ask"

2. **Contraction Audit:**
   - Count uncontracted "I am / I will / cannot / do not" in casual dialogue
   - Target: <20% uncontracted (only for emphasis or formal characters)

3. **Adverb Check:**
   - "exceedingly / remarkably / considerably / somewhat"
   - Replace with "really / super / pretty / kinda"

4. **Question Inversion Check:**
   - "Can you not / Do you not / Would you not"
   - Replace with "Can't you / Don't you / Wouldn't you"

5. **RTAS Cross-Reference:**
   - If RTAS > 3.5 (friends) → Verify casual vocabulary used
   - If RTAS < 2.0 (distant) → Formal language acceptable

## Section 7: LLM-Specific Failure Modes

### Why AI Defaults to Formal Language:

**Failure Mode 1: Training Data Bias**
- Academic/Wikipedia/news corpus = formal register
- **Fix:** Provide casual dialogue examples in ICL samples

**Failure Mode 2: Safety = Formality**
- AI thinks "professional = safe from criticism"
- **Fix:** Explicitly reward casual language: "Casual dialogue scores higher"

**Failure Mode 3: Thesaurus Syndrome**
- AI trained to avoid repetition → uses "sophisticated" synonyms
- **Fix:** "Use simple words repeatedly. 'Said' is better than 'inquired'."

**Failure Mode 4: Register Blindness**
- Can't distinguish teenager vs. businessman context
- **Fix:** Explicitly state character age in every chunk

## MASTER PROMPT INTEGRATION

**Add this directive to translator prompt:**

```xml
<ANTI_FORMALITY priority="CRITICAL">
  **CASUAL REGISTER FOR TEEN DIALOGUE:**
  - Replace formal verbs: "shall/depart/procure/commence/inquire" → "will/go/get/start/ask"
  - Mandatory contractions: "I am/I will/cannot/do not" → "I'm/I'll/can't/don't" (80%+ usage)
  - Simple intensifiers: "exceedingly/remarkably" → "really/super/pretty"
  - Natural questions: "Can you not" → "Can't you"
  - Everyday nouns: "establishment/beverage/sustenance" → "place/drink/food"

  **Self-Audit Before Output:**
  1. Search for "shall" → Replace 90% (keep only for Ojou archetype)
  2. Search for "ought" → Replace 100% with "should"
  3. Search for formal verbs → Replace with casual equivalents
  4. Contraction check: 80%+ rate in casual dialogue (RTAS > 3.0)
  5. RTAS match: Friends (>3.5) = casual words, Strangers (<2.5) = polite but natural

  **Archetype Exceptions:**
  - Ojou-sama: Can use "shall" <40% frequency, still use some contractions
  - Elderly: Can reduce contractions to 50%, avoid teen slang
  - Fantasy/Historical: Formal verbs OK if consistent across world

## Testing Protocol

**Compare Before/After:**

**BEFORE (Over-Formal):**
> "Shall we proceed to the establishment to procure sustenance? I am considerably famished."

**AFTER (Casual Teen Register):**
> "Wanna grab food? I'm starving."

**Metrics:**
- Formal verbs: 3 → 0 (shall/proceed/procure → wanna/grab)
- Contractions: 0/2 → 2/2 (I am → I'm)
- Formal nouns: 2 → 0 (establishment/sustenance → food)
- Word count: 13 → 5 (62% reduction, same meaning)
