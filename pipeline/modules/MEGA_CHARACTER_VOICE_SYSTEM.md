# 06_CHARACTER_VOICE_PROFILES

## SECTION 1: VOICE PROFILE PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principle:** Character voice = **vocabulary + sentence structure + fillers + prohibited words + emotional range**.

Each archetype has distinct linguistic fingerprints that remain consistent across RTAS tiers (though formality adjusts).

**Usage:** Consult this module when:
- Character dialogue feels generic
- Unsure which words fit archetype
- Need filler word guidance
- Checking prohibited vocabulary

  → Length, complexity, fragment allowance

STEP 5: Add filler words if appropriate
  → Match filler type to archetype

STEP 6: Check emotional range expression
  → How does THIS archetype express joy/anger/affection?

STEP 7: Verify contractions frequency
  → Module 01 RTAS tier + archetype modifier

STEP 8: Self-correct against prohibited vocabulary
  → Section 4.1 forbidden words

STEP 9: Compare to Module 05 golden samples
  → Does voice match archetype examples?

**07_LONG_VOWEL_ROMANIZATION.md — JAPANESE LONG VOWEL ROMANIZATION GUIDE**
**Module Status:** ACTIVE & AUTHORITATIVE
**Purpose:** Proper romanization of Japanese long vowels in names and terms
---

# 07_LONG_VOWEL_ROMANIZATION

## RTAS Scoring Logic

**Definition** – Relationship Tension & Affection Score (RTAS) measures intimacy on a 1.0‑5.0 scale.
**Baseline** – 3.0
**Modifiers** – Pronouns (+0.3‑+0.7), honorifics (‑0.8‑+0.5), particles (+0.2‑+0.4), contextual keywords (‑2.0‑+1.5), proxemics (‑0.5‑+1.2).
**Formula** – `RTAS_FINAL = 3.0 + Σ(MODIFIERS)`

## SECTION 1: LONG VOWEL FUNDAMENTALS

### 1.1 WHAT ARE LONG VOWELS?

In Japanese, long vowels (長音, chōon) extend the duration of a vowel sound. They are critical for accurate name romanization and must be preserved to maintain authenticity.

**Common Long Vowel Patterns:**
- **おう (ou)** → Romanize as **-ou** or **-ō** (e.g., みどう → Midou, こうじ → Kouji)
- **おお (oo)** → Romanize as **-oo** or **-ō** (e.g., おおの → Oono, とおる → Tooru)
- **えい (ei)** → Romanize as **-ei** (e.g., けいこ → Keiko, せんせい → sensei)
- **いい (ii)** → Romanize as **-ii** (e.g., にいな → Niina)
- **うう (uu)** → Romanize as **-uu** (e.g., ゆうき → Yuuki)

---

### 1.2 PRIORITY SYSTEM FOR ROMANIZATION

**PRIORITY 1: Ruby Text (Furigana)**
- If ruby text is provided in the source, **follow it exactly**
- Ruby text represents the author's intended romanization
- Example: If 御堂 has ruby みどう, romanize as **Midou** (not Mido)

**PRIORITY 2: Katakana Spelling**
- For katakana names, follow the katakana exactly
- ミドウ → **Midou**, ミド → **Mido**

**PRIORITY 3: Standard Romanization Rules**
- When no ruby/katakana is available, apply standard Hepburn romanization
- Preserve long vowels using **-ou/-oo/-ei/-ii/-uu** format

---

## SECTION 2: ROMANIZATION RULES BY VOWEL TYPE

### 2.1 O-VOWEL EXTENSIONS (Most Common)

#### **Pattern: おう (ou)**
**Rule:** Romanize as **-ou** (preferred) or **-ō** (macron alternative)

**Common Names:**
- みどう (御堂) → **Midou** (not Mido)
- こうじ (浩二) → **Kouji** (not Koji)
- そうた (颯太) → **Souta** (not Sota)
- りょう (涼) → **Ryou** (not Ryo)

**Why -ou over -ō:**
- More accessible (no special characters needed)
- Clearer pronunciation guide for English readers
- Matches common Japanese romanization conventions

#### **Pattern: おお (oo)**
**Rule:** Romanize as **-oo** (preferred) or **-ō** (macron alternative)

**Common Names:**
- おおの (大野) → **Oono** (not Ono)
- とおる (徹) → **Tooru** (not Toru)
- もも (桃) → **Momo** (already has double-o)

---

### 2.2 E-VOWEL EXTENSIONS

#### **Pattern: えい (ei)**
**Rule:** Romanize as **-ei** (preserve both characters)

**Common Names:**
- けいこ (恵子) → **Keiko** (not Keko)
- れいな (玲奈) → **Reina** (not Rena)
- せいじ (誠司) → **Seiji** (not Seji)

**Exception:** Common words like せんせい (sensei) keep **-ei**

---

### 2.3 I-VOWEL EXTENSIONS

#### **Pattern: いい (ii)**
**Rule:** Romanize as **-ii** (double-i)

**Common Names:**
- にいな (新奈) → **Niina** (not Nina)
- しいな (椎名) → **Shiina** (not Shina)

---

### 2.4 U-VOWEL EXTENSIONS

#### **Pattern: うう (uu)**
**Rule:** Romanize as **-uu** (double-u)

**Common Names:**
- ゆうき (勇気) → **Yuuki** (not Yuki)
- りゅう (竜) → **Ryuu** (not Ryu)
- しゅう (秋) → **Shuu** (not Shu)

---

## SECTION 3: PRACTICAL APPLICATION

### 3.1 DETECTION WORKFLOW

**Step 1: Check for Ruby Text**
```
Source: 御堂<ruby>みどう</ruby>
Action: Use ruby → **Midou**
```

**Step 2: Check Katakana Spelling**
```
Source: ミドウ・トモヤ
Action: Follow katakana → **Midou Tomoya**
```

**Step 3: Analyze Hiragana/Kanji**
```
Source: みどう (no ruby)
Action: Apply standard rules → **Midou**
```

---

### 3.2 CONSISTENCY RULES

**Rule 1: Once Established, Lock It**
- First appearance sets the romanization for the entire work
- Example: If "Midou" appears in Chapter 1, use "Midou" throughout

**Rule 2: Character Name Registry**
- Maintain a mental registry of all character names
- Ensure consistency across chapters

**Rule 3: Avoid Mixing Styles**
- Don't mix **-ou** and **-ō** in the same work
- Choose one style and stick with it

---

### 3.3 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **WRONG:** Dropping long vowels entirely
```
みどう → Mido (INCORRECT)
こうじ → Koji (INCORRECT)
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Preserving long vowels
```
みどう → Midou (CORRECT)
こうじ → Kouji (CORRECT)
```

❌ **WRONG:** Inconsistent romanization
```
Chapter 1: Midou
Chapter 2: Mido (INCONSISTENT)
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Locked consistency
```
Chapter 1: Midou
Chapter 2: Midou (CONSISTENT)
```

---

## SECTION 4: SPECIAL CASES

### 4.1 COMPOUND NAMES

**Rule:** Romanize each component separately, then combine

**Example:**
- 御堂友也 (みどう ともや)
  - 御堂 (みどう) → Midou
  - 友也 (ともや) → Tomoya
  - **Result: Midou Tomoya**

---

### 4.2 HISTORICAL/TRADITIONAL NAMES

**Rule:** Some traditional names have established romanizations

**Examples:**
- 東京 (とうきょう) → **Tokyo** (not Toukyou, established convention)
- 大阪 (おおさか) → **Osaka** (not Oosaka, established convention)

**For Character Names:** Follow standard rules unless the name is a well-known historical figure

### 4.3 WHEN RUBY TEXT CONFLICTS WITH STANDARD RULES

**Priority:** Ruby text ALWAYS wins

**Example:**
```
Kanji: 御堂
Standard reading: みどう (Midou)
Ruby text: みど (Mido)
Action: Use **Mido** (follow ruby)
```

**Rationale:** The author's ruby text represents their creative intent

## SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### 6.1 PRE-TRANSLATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Scan source for all character names
- [ ] Check for ruby text on first appearance
- [ ] Note katakana spellings if provided
- [ ] Create character name registry
- [ ] Lock romanization for each character

### 6.2 DURING TRANSLATION

- [ ] Apply long vowel rules consistently
- [ ] Cross-reference with character registry
- [ ] Flag any ambiguous cases for review
- [ ] Maintain -ou/-oo/-ei/-ii/-uu format

### 6.3 POST-TRANSLATION REVIEW

- [ ] Verify all names match first appearance
- [ ] Check for accidental vowel dropping
- [ ] Ensure no style mixing (-ou vs -ō)
- [ ] Validate against ruby text where available

## SECTION 7: EXAMPLES FROM REAL LIGHT NOVELS

### Example 1: "I Became Friends With The Second Cutest Girl"
```
Character: 御堂友也
Ruby: みどう ともや
Romanization: **Midou Tomoya**
Rationale: Ruby text shows みどう (long vowel present)
```

### Example 2: Generic Fantasy LN
```
Character: 剣士・光二
Ruby: けんし・こうじ
Romanization: Kenshi **Kouji**
Rationale: こうじ has long vowel (ou pattern)
```

### Example 3: School Romance LN
```
Character: 白洲結花
Ruby: しらす ゆいか
Romanization: ShiRTASu **Yuika**
Rationale: ゆいか has no long vowel (standard romanization)
```

---

## SECTION 8: CRITICAL REMINDERS

🔴 **NEVER drop long vowels without explicit ruby text justification**

🔴 **ALWAYS prioritize ruby text over standard romanization**

🔴 **MAINTAIN consistency across all chapters**

🔴 **LOCK romanization on first character appearance**
