# ANTI-EXPOSITION DUMP MODULE

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Purpose:** Eliminate AI tendency to over-explain emotions and motivations
**Target Issue:** LLMs default to telling instead of showing

---

## The Problem: Exposition Dumps

**Definition:** AI explicitly states what characters think/feel instead of letting readers infer from actions, dialogue, and context.

**Why LLMs Do This:**
- Risk aversion: Explaining is "safer" than trusting reader inference
- Training data bias: Academic/journalistic writing favors explicit statements
- Lack of "trust" in context: AI doesn't assume readers remember previous paragraphs

**Impact on Light Novels:**
- Kills dramatic tension
- Insults reader intelligence
- Breaks immersion with meta-commentary
- Turns character moments into psychology textbooks

## Core Principle: SHOW, DON'T TELL

**Bad (Telling):**
> "She was angry because he forgot their promise. This made her feel betrayed and hurt."

**Good (Showing):**
> "She turned away, fists clenched. 'You forgot.'"

## Section 1: Emotion Exposition

### 1.1 Explicitly Stating Emotions

**Pattern:** "She felt [emotion]" / "He was [emotion]"
**Problem:** Removes reader engagement. Let actions/dialogue convey emotion.

| ❌ Exposition Dump | ✅ Show Through Action | 🎯 Technique |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| She felt nervous as she waited. | She tapped her foot, checking her phone every few seconds. | Physical behavior |
| He was angry at her comment. | His jaw tightened. "Is that so?" | Microexpression + terse dialogue |
| I felt relieved when she agreed. | My shoulders dropped. "Thank god." | Body language + exclamation |
| She seemed happy about the news. | A smile broke across her face. "Really?!" | Visible reaction |

**Rule:** Replace "felt/was [emotion]" with:
- Physical reactions (blushing, trembling, shoulders drooping)
- Facial expressions (furrowed brow, tight smile)
- Vocal cues (voice cracking, laughing)
- Actions (slamming door, looking away)

**Exception:** First-person POV can use "I felt" sparingly for internal conflict, but prefer sensory descriptions:
- ❌ "I felt anxious."
- ✅ "My stomach twisted into knots."

---

### 1.2 Explaining Character Motivations

**Pattern:** "She did X because she wanted Y" / "He thought about Z, so he did A"
**Problem:** Removes narrative mystery. Trust context to convey motivation.

| ❌ Exposition Dump | ✅ Implied Motivation | 🎯 Context Clues |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| She avoided eye contact because she was hiding something. | She avoided eye contact, fingers twisting together. | Guilty body language implies secrecy |
| He bought her favorite snacks because he wanted to apologize. | He showed up with her favorite snacks, head ducked. "Can we talk?" | Context + action = apology attempt |
| I studied hard because I wanted to impress her. | I stayed up until 3 AM reviewing notes. Tomorrow's test—she'd be there. | Action + context = clear goal |
| She dressed up because she hoped he'd notice. | She changed her outfit three times before settling on the blue dress—his favorite color. | Details reveal intention |

**Rule:** Let readers connect dots. Provide:
- Character actions (buying snacks, dressing up)
- Context clues (her favorite color, upcoming test)
- Emotional reactions (nervous behavior)
- Reader infers motivation naturally

---

### 1.3 Meta-Commentary on Character Psychology

**Pattern:** Narrative voice analyzing *why* character acts this way
**Problem:** Breaks POV, sounds like author's psychology lecture notes

| ❌ Meta-Commentary | ✅ In-Character Perspective | 🎯 Fix |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| She was the type of person who always put others first, even at her own expense. | She glanced at her untouched lunch, then at her friend's empty plate. "Want half of mine?" | Show pattern through repeated action |
| His tsundere personality made it hard for him to express honest feelings. | "I-It's not like I made this for you! I just had extras..." | Let archetype speak through dialogue |
| Deep down, she was actually jealous, though she'd never admit it. | "I'm happy for you," she said, voice a bit too bright. | Contradictory behavior implies hidden feeling |
| This was a defense mechanism from his traumatic past. | He flinched when she raised her hand—just to fix his hair. | Show trauma response, reader infers cause |

**Rule:** NO narrator explaining character psychology. Show behavior, let readers psychoanalyze.

**Exception:** First-person POV can have *unreliable* self-analysis:
- ✅ "I told myself I didn't care. (I definitely cared.)"
- ❌ "I was using sarcasm as a defense mechanism because of my fear of vulnerability."

---

## Section 2: Plot/Context Exposition

### 2.1 Redundant Restatements

**Pattern:** Immediately explaining what dialogue/action just showed
**Problem:** Insults reader comprehension

| ❌ Redundant Explanation | ✅ Trust the Line | 🎯 Cut |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| "I hate you!" she screamed. She was clearly very upset. | "I hate you!" she screamed. | Delete commentary |
| He slammed the door shut, showing his frustration. | He slammed the door shut. | Action is self-evident |
| "You don't understand," he said sadly, his voice full of sadness. | "You don't understand," he said quietly. | "Sadly" + "sadness" = redundant |
| She smiled, happy about the outcome. | She smiled. | Smile = happy (default assumption) |

**Rule:** If the action/dialogue already conveys the emotion, DELETE the explanation.

**Corollary:** Exception for *unexpected* emotions:
- ✅ "She smiled, but her eyes were cold." (Smile ≠ happy here)
- ✅ "'Congratulations,' he said flatly." (Tone contradicts words)

---

### 2.2 Pre-Explaining Actions

**Pattern:** Telling readers what's about to happen before showing it
**Problem:** Kills surprise, creates clunky flow

| ❌ Pre-Explanation | ✅ Show Directly | 🎯 Flow |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| Deciding to confront her, I walked over and asked... | I walked over. "We need to talk." | Start with action |
| She wanted to change the subject, so she said... | "Anyway, about that movie—" | Dialogue IS the subject change |
| Planning his next move, he carefully replied... | He paused. "...I'll think about it." | Show thought via hesitation |
| Trying to lighten the mood, she joked... | "Hey, at least we're not on fire, right?" | Joke IS the mood-lightening |

**Rule:** Cut "deciding to / wanting to / trying to" phrasings. Just DO the action.

---

### 2.3 Summarizing Relationship Dynamics

**Pattern:** Narrator telling us how characters relate instead of showing
**Problem:** Removes discovery, sounds like character wiki dump

| ❌ Summary Dump | ✅ Show Through Interaction | 🎯 Technique |
|----------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| They had been best friends since childhood, so they understood each other perfectly. | "You're thinking about ramen, aren't you?" "...How'd you know?" | Demonstrate familiarity via banter |
| Their relationship was strained after the incident. | He didn't look at her during lunch. She didn't ask why. | Show distance through avoidance |
| She admired him greatly and hung on his every word. | When he spoke, her eyes lit up, leaning forward unconsciously. | Physical attentiveness = admiration |
| He found her annoying but tolerated her presence. | "You're still here?" "Yep!" He sighed but didn't leave. | Contradiction reveals tolerance |

**Rule:** Relationship dynamics emerge from interactions, not narrator summaries.

---

## Section 3: Advanced Show-Don't-Tell Techniques

### 3.1 Sensory Details Over Labels

**Pattern:** Using emotion labels instead of physical sensations
**Fix:** Engage the five senses

| ❌ Label | ✅ Sensory Detail | 🎯 Sense |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| She was scared. | Her breath came shallow and quick. | Sound/Touch |
| He was embarrassed. | Heat crept up his neck. | Touch (warmth) |
| I was anxious. | My palms were slick with sweat. | Touch (moisture) |
| She felt disgusted. | Her stomach churned. | Internal sensation |

**Rule:** What does the emotion *feel like* in the body? Show that.

---

### 3.2 Contradictory Signals (Subtext)

**Pattern:** Characters saying exactly what they mean
**Fix:** Add tension between words and behavior

| ❌ Direct Statement | ✅ Subtext via Contradiction | 🎯 Effect |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| "I don't like you." | "I don't like you," she said, not letting go of his hand. | Actions contradict words = tsundere |
| "I'm fine." | "I'm fine." Her voice cracked. | Tone contradicts content = denial |
| "I'm not jealous." | "I'm not jealous," she muttered, glaring at the other girl. | Behavior betrays claim |
| "I trust you." | "I trust you." He still checked his phone. | Action reveals doubt |

**Rule:** When emotion and words clash, readers trust the behavior more. Use this.

---

### 3.3 Environmental Storytelling

**Pattern:** Telling us about character state directly
**Fix:** Show through environment/objects

| ❌ Direct Tell | ✅ Environmental Show | 🎯 Object as Mirror |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| She was depressed and hadn't been taking care of herself. | Dirty dishes piled in the sink. Her curtains stayed drawn. | Environment reflects mental state |
| He was a meticulous, organized person. | His desk: pens lined up by color, books alphabetized. | Objects reveal personality |
| She missed him terribly. | His hoodie still hung on her chair, unwashed. | Object = emotional anchor |
| He was secretly wealthy but hid it. | Designer watch hidden under frayed sleeve. | Contradictory objects = secret |

**Rule:** What surrounds the character can speak louder than exposition.

## Section 4: Implementation Checklist

**Before Submitting Translation, Self-Audit:**

1. **Ctrl+F Search for Red Flags:**
   - "felt [emotion]" → Replace 80% with physical reactions
   - "because she/he" → Remove 90% (let context imply causation)
   - "wanted to" / "decided to" → Cut preamble, just show action
   - "was the type of person who" → DELETE and show through pattern
   - "Deep down" / "Actually" / "In truth" → Trust subtext instead

2. **Dialogue-After-Action Test:**
   - If you wrote: *Action → Explanation of action*
   - Cut the explanation. Trust the action.

3. **Emotion Inventory:**
   - Count how many times you NAMED an emotion vs SHOWED it
   - Target ratio: 1 named : 4 shown (20% tell, 80% show)

4. **Reader Intelligence Test:**
   - Ask: "Could a reader infer this from context?"
   - If YES → Delete the explicit explanation
   - If NO → ADD context clues, don't explain

---

## Section 5: When Telling is Acceptable

**Telling is FINE when:**

1. **Pacing Requires Speed:**
   - ❌ Showing: "She checked her watch. 3:47. Late. She grabbed her bag, threw on shoes, and sprinted—"
   - ✅ Telling: "She was late."
   - **Use:** Summarizing unimportant setup to get to the scene faster

2. **Establishing Baseline for Contrast:**
   - ✅ "Normally, she was calm and collected. But now—" [SHOW panic]
   - **Use:** Quick "normally X" to make current scene's deviation dramatic

3. **POV Character's Direct Thoughts (First-Person):**
   - ✅ "I was pissed. No, that's putting it mildly—I was livid."
   - **Use:** Internal monologue CAN label emotions if it's characterful

4. **Unreliable Narrator Contrast:**
   - ✅ "I wasn't jealous. (Okay, maybe I was a little jealous.)"
   - **Use:** Character lying to themselves = comedic/dramatic effect

**Golden Ratio: 80% Showing, 20% Telling**

## Section 6: LLM-Specific Failure Modes

### Why AI Defaults to Exposition:

**Failure Mode 1: Safety Bias**
- Training teaches AI: "Explicit > Implicit" to avoid misunderstanding
- **Fix:** Prompt must reward subtlety over clarity

**Failure Mode 2: Context Window Distrust**
- AI doesn't assume reader remembers earlier context
- **Fix:** Explicitly tell AI to trust previous paragraphs

**Failure Mode 3: Risk-Averse Vocabulary**
- Academic/formal training data → defaults to explanatory mode
- **Fix:** Contrastive examples showing "showing" beats "telling"

**Failure Mode 4: Missing Cultural Context**
- Japanese light novels RELY on reader inference (空気を読む)
- **Fix:** Explicitly instruct: "Reader can connect dots"

## MASTER PROMPT INTEGRATION

**Add this directive to translator prompt:**

```xml
<ANTI_EXPOSITION priority="CRITICAL">
  **SHOW, DON'T TELL:**
  - Replace "felt [emotion]" with physical reactions (80% of instances)
  - Remove "because she/he [motivation]" → Let context imply causation
  - Cut meta-commentary analyzing character psychology
  - Delete redundant restatements of what dialogue/action already showed
  - Trust reader intelligence: If context implies it, don't explain it

  **Self-Audit Before Output:**
  1. Search for "felt/was [emotion]" → Replace with sensory details
  2. Search for "because" → Remove if causation is obvious from context
  3. Search for "decided to/wanted to" → Cut preamble, show action directly
  4. Emotion ratio check: 20% labeled, 80% shown through behavior

  **When Telling is OK:**
  - Fast-pacing summaries of unimportant setup
  - Establishing baseline for dramatic contrast
  - First-person internal monologue (if characterful)
  - Unreliable narrator comedy/drama

## Testing Protocol

**Compare Before/After:**

**BEFORE (Exposition-Heavy):**
> Akimi was upset because Yo had been insensitive about her friend. She felt hurt and wanted to be alone. She walked away, deciding to leave him behind.

**AFTER (Show-Based):**
> "Please, just leave me alone now." Akimi stepped onto the escalator without looking back.

**Metrics:**
- Emotion words: 3 → 0 (shown via dialogue + action)
- Causation explained: YES → NO (context implies)
- Word count: 28 → 13 (54% reduction, same meaning)
